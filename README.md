# README (WIP)

## What is this?
This is a test project with reactjs + redux + shopify + tailwind.

## Objective
Learn a little bit about reactjs, redux shopify, and tailwind... please don't use this as a project. It's just a test.

## How to use?
You need to setup your Shopify storefront access token and storefront url in the .env file
there is a sample store in the .env.sample file, including a token of a test Shopify account (I don't know how if the token will be valid forever, it's just a sample token that I found online)

```cp .env.sample .env```

In the project directory, you can run:

```yarn```

to download dependencies, and then:

```yarn start```

to run the app in the development mode,\
then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## What's next?
It will just be an abandoned test project, but I'm sure it will be using it to test more and add more features in the future, but it will never be a real project. There are some (easy to see) limitations in this implementation that will be a lot of fun to implement in a future project.
