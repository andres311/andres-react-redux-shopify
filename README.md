# README (WIP)

## What is this?
This is a simple store front test project using reactjs + redux + shopify + tailwind.

## Objective
Learn a little bit about reactjs, redux shopify, and tailwind... please don't use this as a project. It's just a test.

## How to use?
You need to setup your Shopify storefront access token and url in the .env file
there is a sample store in the .env.sample file, including the token of a test Shopify account (I don't know if the token will be valid forever, it's just a sample token that I found online)

```cp .env.sample .env```

In the project directory, you can run:

```yarn```

to install dependencies, and then:

```yarn start```

to run the app in the development mode,\
then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## What's next?
This test project will be another abandoned test project on the web, but I'm sure I will be using it to test and learn more (adding features and refactoring). There are some (easy to see) limitations in this implementation that will be fun to improve in the future project.
