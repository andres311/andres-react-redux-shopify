# README (WIP)

## What is this?
A simple storefront test project using reactjs + redux + shopify + tailwind.

## Objective
Learn about reactjs, redux shopify, and tailwind. 

## Demo

[https://andres-react-redux-shopify.archondo.xyz](https://andres-react-redux-shopify.archondo.xyz)

## How to use?
You need to set up your Shopify storefront access token and URL in the .env file.\
There is a sample environment file (.env.sample), which includes a token of a test Shopify account.

1 - Get the code from the Github repo

```
git clone https://github.com/andres311/andres-react-redux-shopify.git && cd andres-react-redux-shopify

```

2 - In the directory of the project, make your .env file:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

3 - Add your key and URL in the .env file

4 - Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

5 - Run the app in the development mode :

```
yarn start
```

5- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## What's next?
This test project will be another abandoned test project on the web, but I'm sure I will be using it to learn more (adding features and refactoring). There are some (easy to see) limitations in this implementation that will be fun to improve in the future.
